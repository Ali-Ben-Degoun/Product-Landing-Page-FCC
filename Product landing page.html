			<h2>About Us</h2>
			<p>At Tenga Tours, we have been true explorers for over 30 years, ground breakers, and pioneers of modern expedition travel. We’ve packed our final Encore Explorations 2021 line-up with our family of expert explorers, naturalists, anthropologists, marine biologists, historians and ornithologists, who provide profound and essential understandings of all corners of Morocco, many of whom have contributed to our expeditions for decades, some of whom founded our company. Together these talented women and men bring our travellers 1000 + years of expertise in the field.</p>
			<p>Our trips include walking and cycling tours that take in awe-inspiring scenery and breath-taking wildlife encounters. And we have journeys designed specifically for families, mixed activity vacations and seasonal getaways, perfect for those interested in winter sports. There are unforgettable experiences in top destinations the world over. From your own Sahara safari to a journey of discovery in the north side and pioneering expeditions to the Rif mountains, with Tenga Tours, these are just some of the memories waiting to be made.</p>
